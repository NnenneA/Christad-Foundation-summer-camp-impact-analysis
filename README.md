# Summer Camp Math Program: Impact Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of a summer camp math program run by the CHRISTAD Foundation. The analysis is based on survey responses from 95 participants and aims to measure changes in student attitudes, confidence, and engagement with mathematics. The goal was to validate the program's success and identify areas for future improvement.

The analysis complements the official report.

**Note on Data Privacy:** The original survey data contains personally identifiable information (PII) and therefore **cannot be shared publicly**. This repository focuses on showcasing the analysis methodology, code, and visualized results.

## Key Insights & Impact (Summary)

The data reveals the program was a significant success:
*   **Mindset Shift:** **74.7%** of students reported they "really like" math after the camp.
*   **Confidence Boost:** Over **52%** of students felt "Very confident" in solving math problems.
*   **Teacher Excellence:** **98.9%** of students found the teachers "very helpful and easy to learn from."
*   **Word of Mouth:** The camp achieved a **93.5%** recommendation rate.
*   **Real-World Application:** **86%** of students used something they learned outside the classroom.

## Technical Implementation & Code Showcase

### Tools & Libraries
*   **Language:** Python
*   **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
*   **Data Processing:** Cleaning, categorization, and analysis of survey data.
*   **Visualization:** Creation of informative and publication-ready charts and graphs.

### Analysis Steps (Demonstrated in Code)
The  notebook walks through the entire analytical process:
1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Standardized age groups, cleaned free-text responses, and mapped confidence levels.
2.  **Topic Extraction:** Engineered keywords to categorize fun and difficult topics from open-ended responses (See code snippet below).
3.  **Statistical Analysis & Visualization:** Generated a suite of plots to illustrate key program metrics and findings.

How to Explore This Project
